### About

A little website where I can showcase my work (that isn't linkedin). <br />
Also a place to practice React skills.


### Tech
The site itself is built with React + Nextjs + Tailwind, and hosted on AWS Amplify. I'm using Porkbun as a domain registrar (since Route53 doesn't have `.dev` domains) 

### About the waves
The interactive background waves are made with some math and an html `<canvas>` element, inspired by the fantastic [Aceternity UI library](https://ui.aceternity.com/components/wavy-background).

Check out the source code [here](./app/(components)/BackgroundWaves.jsx).
