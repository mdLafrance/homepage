### About

### Tech
The site itself is built with React + Nextjs + Tailwind, and hosted on AWS Amplify. I'm using Porkbun as a domain registrar (since Route53 doesn't have `.dev` domains :() 

### About the waves
The interactive background waves are made with some math and an html `<canvas>` element. <br />
Check out the source code [here](./public/(components)/BackgroundWaves.jsx).
